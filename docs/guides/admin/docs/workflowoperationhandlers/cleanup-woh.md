Notes:

* If *delete-external* is set to true, the externally referenced media package elements will be removed from its source
  where the value of *preserve-flavors* does not match

  (see [Opencast Configuration on Multiple Servers Setup](../installation/multiple-servers/#orgopencastorganization-mh_default_orgcfg))
