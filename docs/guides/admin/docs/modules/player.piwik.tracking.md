Opencast Player - Piwik Tracking Plugin
=======================================

This plugin allows to user Piwik (https://piwik.org/) to track usage data. To setup Piwik please follow the instructions
on the piwik website: https://piwik.org/docs/installation/#the-5-minut-piwik-installation

The plugin respects the [Do-Not-Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) settings of a browser. You might also
need to consider the legal requirements of your country when you setup Piwik.

This plugin uses a Piwik javascript library that is loaded from the remote Piwik server!

Tested Piwik version: 3.0.2

The configurations for the piwik player plugin are done for each tenant. So the configuration keys are located in
`.../etc/org.opencast.organization-mh_default_org.cfg`.

To activate the plugin set:

    prop.player.piwik.server=http://localhost/piwik

Where localhost should be replaced with your Piwik server URL.

Tracked Data
------------

Additional to the event data that can be turned on for each event (see above), this Opencast specific data is tracked
if tracking is allowed:

- Page name as "<title of the event> - <lecturer name>"
- Custom Piwik variables:
  - "event" as "<title of the event> (<event id>)"
  - "series" as "<title of the series> (<series id>)"
  - "presenter"
  - "view_mode" which can be "desktop", "mobile" or "embed"

Heartbeat data does not show how long a video has been played but how long a viewer remained on the page, while the page
was in the foreground.
